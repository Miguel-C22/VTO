# Remove Comments Command

Clean up the codebase by removing unnecessary comments while preserving important documentation:

1. Remove TODO comments that are completed
2. Remove debug comments and console.log statements
3. Remove commented-out code blocks
4. Keep JSDoc comments and important documentation
5. Keep TypeScript interface documentation
6. Preserve license headers and important notices

Focus on: $ARGUMENTS (if no arguments, scan entire src/ directory)

After cleanup, provide a summary of what was removed.
